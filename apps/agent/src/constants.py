DESCRIPTION = """
This is a simple chat agent I have built for my own practical understanding of how to use LangChain and OpenAI APIs. The core LLM leverages the ReAct prompt framework, has short-term memory, and access to a handful of tools including DuckDuckGo Web Search, Wikipedia look up, and a Chain-of-Thought calculator to offload complex math problems.

Practical & Potential Next Steps:
- Define a dataset to evaluate the agent's performance across various tasks, specifically tool calling accuracy, and refining prompts.
- Implement observability to de-bug the agent's thought sequences.
- Fallback logic for when DuckDuckGo's API limits are reached
- Long-Term Memory and [better] Short-Term Memory
- Document upload & analysis (requiring RAG -- OCR, chunking, vectorDB, memory, etc.)
