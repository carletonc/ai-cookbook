### AI-Powered Domain Search & Recommendation Engine
*Demonstrating advanced RAG, agentic workflows, and domain-specific feature engineering through a full GenAI product lifecycle*

---

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Project Vision & Business Impact**
**Problem:** Generic search fails in specialized domains where context, jargon, and subjective "best" recommendations matter.

**Solution:** End-to-end AI system that masters domain language and delivers contextually-aware results through hybrid retrieval and intelligent feature engineering.

**Transferable to:** Internal knowledge bases, customer support, legal research, e-commerce recommendations, et cetera
