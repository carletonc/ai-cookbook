# Prompt Tuning & Evaluation [WIP] üéØ

> **Note**: This is a template module designed to be customized! While it comes with some general evaluation metrics, you should modify and extend these based on your specific use case and requirements.

This module template helps systematically evaluate and improve your prompts using quantitative metrics and iterative refinement. Think of it as a starting point - the evaluation metrics and scoring system are meant to be adapted to your needs.

## üö¶ Running the Demo App

To launch the interactive prompt tuning demo, run:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

from this directory.

## üîç Current Evaluation Metrics

- **Factualness & Accuracy**: Checks if the output matches known facts and data
- **Coherence & Structure**: Evaluates logical flow and organization
- **Conciseness**: Measures information density and brevity
- **Format Compliance**: Verifies adherence to requested output format
- **Hallucination Detection**: Identifies unsupported claims

## üöÄ Potential Improvements

### Domain-Specific Evaluations

Here are some examples of specialized evaluation metrics you could add:

#### Code Generation
- **Syntax Validity**: Check if generated code compiles
- **Test Coverage**: Verify test cases are included
- **Security Best Practices**: Scan for common vulnerabilities
- **Documentation Quality**: Assess inline comments and docstrings

#### Financial Analysis
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Verify calculations and formulas
- **Risk Disclosure**: Check for appropriate risk warnings
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure adherence to financial regulations
- **Time Series Consistency**: Validate historical data references

#### Medical Content
- **Clinical Accuracy**: Verify against medical literature
- **Patient-Friendly Language**: Assess readability levels
- **Medication Safety**: Check drug interaction warnings
- **Diagnostic Completeness**: Ensure comprehensive symptom coverage

#### Customer Service
- **Tone Appropriateness**: Measure empathy and professionalism
- **Resolution Completeness**: Check if all questions are addressed
- **Policy Compliance**: Verify alignment with company policies
- **Escalation Triggers**: Identify when to route to human agents

## üí° Implementation Tips

- Store evaluation results in a database to track improvements
- Use A/B testing to compare prompt versions
- Consider weighted scoring based on use case priorities
- Implement automated regression testing for prompts

## üîÑ Feedback Loop

1. Initial Prompt Design
2. Run Evaluations
3. Analyze Scores
4. Refine Prompt
5. Repeat until desired performance is achieved
