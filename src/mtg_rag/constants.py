APP_DESCRIPTION = """
This app allows you to search for Magic: The Gathering cards and receive recommendations using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It leverages both official card data, the comprehensive rules, and (in future versions) community knowledge—including slang and nuanced reasoning—to provide context-aware answers and recommendations. The goal is to teach the LLM the deep, embedded meanings and player language that go beyond what is found in the official rules or on the web.
